# generalized-quantifiers

Python code to collect and compare and visualize quantifier statistics on (1) Brown corpus, (2) a small sample (100M tokens) of the WaCky corpus
of Baroni et al., plus (3) two small question corpora. It also tries to fit a power law on quantifier distribution (via log-log 
regression). It requires the installation of matplotlib and SciPy on the Python side, a working LaTeX installation, and the 
four corpora used.

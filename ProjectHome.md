Python scripts for analyzing the distribution of tractable and intractable
generalized quantifiers in English corpora. These Python scripts:

  * check for generalized quantifiers in (large scale) English corpora such as Baroni's et al. [ukWaC](http://wacky.sslmit.unibo.it/doku.php) corpus,
  * visualize the statistics obtained, and
  * check for power-law distributions (via log-log regressions) and for statistically   significant bias.

Required Python libraries:

  * Python 2.6.x
  * matplotlib, scipy, numpy and nltk
